## ðŸ“Š Data Overview

- **Total Episodes**: 50
- **Episodes with Signals**: 49 (98%)
- **Average Signals per Episode**: 12
- **Signal Types**:
  - `investable`: Investment opportunities
  - `competitive`: Market intelligence
  - `portfolio`: Portfolio company mentions
  - `sound_bite`: Key quotes and insights

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Recommendations

### Dashboard View
1. **Signal Pills**: Color-code by type (green=investable, blue=competitive, purple=portfolio, gray=soundbite)
2. **Relevance Score**: Show as a visual indicator (progress bar or stars)
3. **Time to Read**: Calculate from signal count (assume 5 seconds per signal)
4. **Quick Actions**: Listen, Share, Save for Later

### Episode Detail View
1. **Signal Timeline**: Show signals with timestamps for easy navigation
2. **Audio Player**: Integrate with timestamp jumping
3. **Share Options**: Pre-fill with episode title and key signals
4. **Related Episodes**: Show other episodes with similar signals

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Notes

1. **No Authentication**: Currently disabled for MVP
2. **CORS**: Enabled for all origins
3. **Rate Limiting**: None currently
4. **Error Handling**: All endpoints return standard HTTP status codes
5. **Pagination**: Not needed for MVP (only 49 episodes)

## ðŸ“± Mobile Considerations

- All endpoints return lightweight JSON
- Audio URLs can be streamed
- Signals are bite-sized for mobile reading
- Consider offline caching for episode briefs

## ðŸš¦ Testing the API

Quick test to verify the API is working:

```bash
# Get dashboard feed
curl https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/intelligence/dashboard?limit=5

# Get specific episode
curl https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/intelligence/brief/02fc268c-61dc-4074-b7ec-882615bc6d85
```

## ðŸ“ž Support
