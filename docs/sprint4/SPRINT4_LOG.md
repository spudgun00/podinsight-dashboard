#### Session 1 Tasks Completed:
1. ‚úÖ Created directory structure for Episode Intelligence components
   - `/components/intelligence/` directory created
   - Moved V0 components from dashboard to intelligence folder
   
2. ‚úÖ Identified V0 components:
   - `episode-intelligence-cards.tsx` - Main wrapper with header/filters
   - `episode-card.tsx` - Individual episode card component
   - `expandable-episode-grid.tsx` - 3+3 expandable grid layout
   - `intelligence-brief-modal.tsx` - Detailed intelligence modal
   - `all-episodes-view.tsx` - Full episodes list view

#### Issues Discovered:
1. **Missing Mock Data**: All components import from `@/lib/mock-episode-data` which doesn't exist
2. **Missing Type Definitions**: Episode interface needs to be created
3. **Missing Tailwind Classes**: Signal colors (signal-red, signal-orange, etc.) not defined
4. **Missing Dependencies**: Components use framer-motion which is already installed

#### Next Steps for Session 3:
1. Apply similar premium UI/UX improvements to IntelligenceBriefModal
2. Update EpisodeCard component with new design patterns
3. Enhance the main episode-intelligence-cards wrapper
4. Test all component interactions and responsive behavior
5. Implement API integration for real episode data
6. Add loading states and error handling

### Technical Notes:

#### Episode Type Structure:
```typescript
interface Episode {
  id: string
  title: string
  abbreviation: string // e.g., "AIL" for All-In
  signal: 'red_hot' | 'high_value' | 'market_intel' | 'portfolio_mention'
  score: number // 0-100
  timeAgo: string // e.g., "2h ago"
  duration: string // e.g., "1h 23m"
  intel: string[] // Array of intelligence points
  podcast: string
  publishedAt: Date
}
```

#### Signal Color Scheme:
- `red_hot` (üî¥): Score 90-100 - Critical signals
- `high_value` (üü†): Score 70-89 - Important opportunities  
- `market_intel` (üü¢): Score 50-69 - Market insights
- `portfolio_mention` (üîµ): Portfolio company mentions

#### Integration Point:
The Episode Intelligence section should be inserted in `app/page.tsx` between the Topic Velocity Chart and Sentiment Heatmap components.

## Story 4: API Integration Implementation

### Session 10: Episode Intelligence API Integration
**Date**: 2025-07-08
**Developer**: James Gill
**Status**: Completed
**Duration**: ~90 minutes

#### Context
- Story 3 (Dashboard Component) was already completed with mock data
- Story 5b (API Endpoints) was already implemented by backend team
- Task: Connect the frontend Episode Intelligence cards to live API data

#### Key Challenge
The API returns episode-based data structure, but the UI displays card-based categories. Required creating a transformation layer to map:
- `investable` signals ‚Üí Market Signals + Deal Intelligence cards
- `competitive` signals ‚Üí Portfolio Pulse card
- `portfolio` signals ‚Üí Portfolio Pulse card
- `sound_bite` signals ‚Üí Executive Brief + Market Signals cards

#### Tasks Completed

1. ‚úÖ **Created TypeScript Type System**
   - `/types/intelligence.ts` - Defines API and UI interfaces
   - Mapped API response structure to UI component needs
   - Added type safety for all data transformations

2. ‚úÖ **Built Data Transformation Layer**
   - `/utils/intelligence-transformer.ts` - Core transformation logic
   - Implements signal categorization by type
   - Maps confidence scores to urgency levels (critical/high/normal)
   - Handles signal duplication for multiple cards

3. ‚úÖ **Implemented React Query Integration**
   - `/hooks/useIntelligenceDashboard.ts` - Data fetching hook
   - 60-second auto-refresh interval
   - Stale-while-revalidate pattern
   - Error handling and retry logic

4. ‚úÖ **Created API-Connected Dashboard Component**
   - `/components/dashboard/actionable-intelligence-cards-api.tsx`
   - Integrates all hooks and transformations
   - Handles loading states with skeleton UI
   - Maintains existing UI/UX from Story 3

5. ‚úÖ **Built Intelligence Brief Modal**
   - `/components/dashboard/intelligence-brief-modal.tsx`
   - Displays detailed episode information
   - Implements email/Slack sharing functionality
   - Connected to `/api/intelligence/brief/{episode_id}` endpoint

6. ‚úÖ **Set Up Infrastructure**
   - `/providers/query-provider.tsx` - React Query provider
   - Updated `/app/layout.tsx` with QueryProvider wrapper
   - Created example page at `/app/dashboard-api-example/page.tsx`

7. ‚úÖ **Created Comprehensive Testing Guide**
   - `/docs/episode-intelligence-testing-guide.md`
   - Instructions for testing with mock data (NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA=true)
   - Instructions for testing with live API (NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA=false)
   - Complete troubleshooting guide
   - Visual success indicators

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Signal Transformation Algorithm:**
```typescript
// Urgency mapping based on confidence scores
confidence > 0.8 ‚Üí critical (red, pulsing animation)
confidence 0.6-0.8 ‚Üí high (yellow)
confidence < 0.6 ‚Üí normal (green)
```

**API Endpoints Integrated:**
1. `GET /api/intelligence/dashboard?limit=8` - Main dashboard data
2. `GET /api/intelligence/brief/{episode_id}` - Detailed episode view
3. `POST /api/intelligence/share` - Sharing functionality

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Client-side data transformation to reduce API load
- React Query caching with 60-second stale time
- Prefetch on hover for episode details
