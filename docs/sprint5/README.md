# Sprint 5: Modal.com Prewarming

## Sprint Overview
**Duration**: January 11, 2025  
**Goal**: Eliminate the 18-second cold start delay for Modal.com's embedding service  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

## Problem
The search functionality experienced an 18-second delay on first use due to Modal.com's embedding service cold start. This created a poor user experience where users would click search, type their query, submit, and then wait nearly 20 seconds for results.

## Solution
Implemented prewarming that triggers when users open the search modal, giving Modal time to warm up while users type their query. By the time they submit (typically 3-5 seconds later), Modal is ready and responds instantly.

## Implementation
- **Component Modified**: `AISearchModalEnhanced` (the production search modal)
- **Approach**: Direct backend API call to `/api/prewarm` when modal opens
- **Cooldown**: 3-minute cooldown to prevent excessive requests
- **Cost Savings**: ~$80-90/month (vs 24/7 warm instance)

## Key Achievements
- ‚úÖ Eliminated 18-second cold start delay
- ‚úÖ Clean implementation in single file
- ‚úÖ No user-facing complexity or errors
- ‚úÖ 80-90% cost reduction vs always-warm approach
- ‚úÖ Cleaned up git history from previous failed attempt

## Quick Test
See **[PREWARMING_TEST_GUIDE.md](./PREWARMING_TEST_GUIDE.md)** for detailed testing instructions.

**TL;DR**: Open DevTools ‚Üí Click üß† button ‚Üí Check for `/api/prewarm` request ‚Üí Search should be fast!

## Next Steps
The prewarming implementation is complete and deployed. Potential future enhancements:
- Add metrics tracking for prewarm success rate
- Adjust cooldown based on usage patterns
- Consider prewarming other services if needed
