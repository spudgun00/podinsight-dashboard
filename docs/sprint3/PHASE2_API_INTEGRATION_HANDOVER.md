# Sprint 3 Phase 2 - API Integration Handover

## Session Summary (June 29, 2025)

### What Was Accomplished ✅

1. **API Integration Complete**
   - Connected command bar to production API: `https://podinsight-api.vercel.app`
   - Created proxy routes to handle CORS issues
   - Implemented proper error handling and timeouts

2. **Audio Player Integration**
   - Integrated on-demand audio clip generation
   - Added play/pause functionality with loading states
   - Audio clips generated via `/api/v1/audio_clips/{episode_id}` endpoint

3. **Fixed Critical Bug**
   - **Issue**: User couldn't type in search bar
   - **Root Cause**: `CommandBarContent` was defined inside the component, causing React to recreate it on every render
   - **Solution**: Created `search-command-bar-fixed.tsx` with proper component structure

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Added AbortController for request cancellation
   - Implemented 25-second timeout for API calls
   - Added debouncing (500ms) for search queries

### Current Status 🎯

- **Working Features**:
  - ✅ Search functionality with real API
  - ✅ AI-synthesized answers with citations
  - ✅ Audio playback for 30-second clips
  - ✅ Loading states and error handling
  - ✅ Keyboard shortcuts (/, ⌘K)

- **Known Issues**:
  - ⚠️ Some queries timeout (e.g., "venture capital valuations")
  - ⚠️ API cold starts can take 15-20 seconds
  - ⚠️ 2 test failures documented as tech debt

/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://podinsight-api.vercel.app
```

### Key Code Changes 🔧

1. **API URL Configuration** (`.env.local`):
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://podinsight-api.vercel.app
   ```

2. **Search API Proxy** (`/app/api/search/route.ts`):
   - Handles CORS by making server-side requests
   - 25-second timeout with AbortController
   - Route timeout increased to 30 seconds

3. **Component Fix** (`search-command-bar-fixed.tsx`):
   - Moved `CommandBarContent` outside the main component
   - Fixed stale closure in `performSearch` callback
   - Added proper audio state management

4. **Test Page Fix** (`/app/test-command-bar/page.tsx`):
   - Moved fetch override into useEffect
   - Proper cleanup on unmount

### API Endpoints 🌐

1. **Search Endpoint**:
   - URL: `POST /api/search`
   - Request: `{ query: string, limit: number, offset?: number }`
   - Response: Includes `answer` object with AI synthesis and citations

2. **Audio Clips Endpoint**:
   - URL: `GET /api/v1/audio_clips/{episode_id}?start_time_ms={ms}`
   - Response: `{ clip_url: string, cache_hit: boolean, generation_time_ms: number }`

### Testing Instructions 🧪

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jamesgill/PodInsights/podinsight-dashboard
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access the test page**: http://localhost:3000/test-command-bar

3. **Test queries**:
   - "AI valuations" (usually works)
   - "venture capital valuations" (may timeout)
   - "startup funding"
   - "DePIN infrastructure"

4. **Toggle mock data** if API is slow or unavailable

### Outstanding Tasks 📋

1. **Performance**: Investigate why some queries timeout on the backend
2. **Testing**: Fix the 2 remaining test failures (stale closure issue)
3. **Cleanup**: Consider renaming `search-command-bar-fixed.tsx` back to original
4. **Integration**: Update main dashboard to use the fixed component

### Important Context Files 📚

1. `/docs/sprint3/sprint3-command-bar-playbookv2.md` - Complete sprint guide
2. `/docs/sprint3/API_DOCUMENTATION_PHASE2.md` - API documentation
3. `/docs/sprint3/SPRINT3_TESTING_HANDOVER_V3.md` - Testing status
4. `/docs/sprint3/HOW_TO_RUN_DASHBOARD_AND_SEARCH_BAR.md` - Running instructions
5. `/components/dashboard/search-command-bar-fixed.tsx` - Working component

### Debug Information 🐛

- Server logs: `tail -f /tmp/nextjs.log`
- Check port 3000: `lsof -i :3000`
- Kill process: `kill -9 <PID>`

### Gemini Zen Assistance 🤖

Gemini Zen helped diagnose the input focus issue by identifying that `CommandBarContent` was being recreated on every render due to being defined inside the parent component.

## Next Session Prompt

Use this prompt to continue in the next session:

```
I need to continue Sprint 3 Phase 2 implementation for PodInsightHQ command bar.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
@docs/sprint3/sprint3-command-bar-playbookv2.md
@docs/sprint3/API_DOCUMENTATION_PHASE2.md
@docs/sprint3/PHASE2_API_INTEGRATION_HANDOVER.md

CURRENT STATUS:
- API integration is complete and working
- Audio playback is integrated
- Fixed input focus bug by creating search-command-bar-fixed.tsx
- Some queries timeout (backend performance issue)
- Using proxy routes to handle CORS

IMMEDIATE TASKS:
1. Investigate and fix timeout issues for queries like "venture capital valuations"
2. Consider implementing response caching to improve performance
3. Update the main dashboard to use the fixed search component
4. Clean up by renaming search-command-bar-fixed.tsx to search-command-bar.tsx

KEY FILES TO REVIEW:
@components/dashboard/search-command-bar-fixed.tsx - Working component
@app/api/search/route.ts - Search API proxy
@app/test-command-bar/page.tsx - Test page

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Some search queries timeout after 25 seconds
- 2 tests still failing due to component architecture
- Backend OpenAI synthesis can be slow (15-20s cold starts)

Please help me continue with the immediate tasks, starting with investigating the timeout issues.
```

### Additional Notes for Next Session 📝

1. The timeout issue appears to be on the backend API, not our frontend
2. The search itself completes quickly (~2.4s) but OpenAI synthesis times out
3. Consider implementing client-side caching of search results
4. May need to coordinate with backend team about synthesis performance

Good luck with the next session! 🚀
