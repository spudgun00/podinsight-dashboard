# Audio API Fix Update - Dashboard Team

**Date**: June 30, 2025  
**Time**: 5:58 PM BST  
**Status**: ✅ CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED

## Issue Found & Fixed

The FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED error was caused by a **route ordering bug** in the API code:

1. The health endpoint was defined AFTER the dynamic `/{episode_id}` route
2. This caused `/health` to be captured as an episode ID
3. ALL requests were failing because of this routing issue

## What Was Fixed

```python
# BEFORE (broken):
@router.get("/{episode_id}")  # This captured ALL paths including /health
...
@router.get("/health")  # Never reached!

# AFTER (fixed):
@router.get("/health")  # Now properly accessible
...
@router.get("/{episode_id}")  # Only captures actual episode IDs
```

## Additional Improvements

1. **Simplified GUID handling**: The API now treats GUIDs as the primary identifier
2. **Better error messages**: Clear indication when ID format is invalid
3. **Cleaner code**: Removed unnecessary complexity

## Current Status

- ✅ Fix pushed to GitHub
- ⏳ Vercel deployment in progress (~6 minutes)
- ✅ Lambda is working correctly
- ✅ MongoDB lookups verified

## Test After Deployment

Once Vercel finishes deploying (check in ~6 minutes):

```bash
# 1. Test health endpoint
curl https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/v1/audio_clips/health

# 2. Test with your GUID
curl "https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/v1/audio_clips/673b06c4-cf90-11ef-b9e1-0b761165641d?start_time_ms=556789"

# 3. Test with known working episode
curl "https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/v1/audio_clips/685ba776e4f9ec2f0756267a?start_time_ms=30000"
```

## Expected Results

1. Health endpoint should return:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "service": "audio_clips",
     "lambda_configured": true,
     "mongodb_configured": true
   }
   ```

2. Audio requests should return:
   ```json
   {
     "clip_url": "https://...",
     "cache_hit": true/false,
     "episode_id": "...",
     "start_time_ms": ...,
     "duration_ms": 30000,
     "generation_time_ms": ...
   }
   ```

## Key Understanding

- **GUIDs are the canonical identifier** (link MongoDB to S3)
- **ObjectIds are MongoDB internals only** (no S3 relationship)
- **Search API correctly returns GUIDs** (what you need)

---

**The route ordering bug was preventing ANY request from working. This is now fixed.**

Please test again once Vercel deployment completes (~6 minutes from now).

# Dashboard Quarterly Chart Fixes

**Date**: July 2, 2025  
**Time**: 10:15 AM BST  
**Status**: ✅ FIXES COMPLETED

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Q2 Percentage Calculation (0% for all topics)
**Problem**: Q2 was showing 0% change for all topics in the legend and notable performer  
**Root Cause**: 
- Legend was showing week-over-week (w/w) percentages
- Last 2 weeks of Q2 (W25-W26) had no data, resulting in 0% w/w change
- Period trends were calculated correctly but not displayed in the legend

**Fix**: 
- Updated legend formatter to use period trends in quarterly view
- Shows full quarter percentage change (W14 to W24) instead of w/w
- Display format: "AI Agents ↓56% (Q2)" instead of "AI Agents →0% w/w"

### 2. Q3 Comparison Line Extended Too Far
**Problem**: Q3 comparison line from Q2 extended to W39 instead of stopping at W37  
**Root Cause**: 
- Code was checking current quarter's data to determine comparison line length
- Should have been checking previous quarter's data length instead

**Fix**:
- Count actual data weeks in previous quarter (Q2 has 11 weeks: W14-W24)
- Limit comparison line to same length (Q3 shows Q2 line only for W27-W37)
- Ensures apples-to-apples comparison of equal time periods

### 3. Q3 Showing "Trending Topic" with No Data
**Problem**: Q3 displayed "Trending Topic: AI Agents" despite having no data  
**Root Cause**: 
- Trending topic calculation didn't check if quarter had any data
- Was based on highest total mentions, defaulting to first topic

**Fix**:
- Added check for totalMentions > 0 before calculating trending topic
- Shows "—" when no data exists in the quarter
- Only displays trending topic when actual data is present

## Technical Changes

1. **calculatePeriodTrends** (line 710-780):
   - Added logic to find first/last weeks with actual data
   - Handles null values in incomplete quarters correctly

2. **customLegendFormatter** (line 891-918):
   - Uses periodTrends in quarterly view instead of weeklyTrends
   - Shows quarter label (Q2) instead of w/w

3. **mergeQuarterData** (line 431-454):
   - Counts valid data weeks in previous quarter
   - Limits comparison line to match previous quarter's data length

4. **calculateStats** (line 543-547):
   - Only calculates trending topic when totalMentions > 0

## Testing Verified

- ✅ Q1: Shows correct period percentages
- ✅ Q2: Shows correct percentages (W14 to W24)
- ✅ Q3: Comparison line stops at W37, no trending topic shown
- ✅ Q4: Behaves correctly with limited comparison data

## Additional UI Improvements (July 2, 2025 - 10:45 AM BST)

### 4. Removed Intrusive Quarterly Comparison Banner
**Problem**: Blue banner showing "Comparing NaN Q3 with Q2" pushed chart down  
**Root Cause**: Banner was positioned above chart and had date parsing issue
**Fix**: Removed the banner entirely for cleaner UI

### 5. Fixed Chart Height Inconsistency Between Views
**Problem**: Chart shrank vertically when switching from Time Range to Quarters view  
**Root Cause**: 
- Quarters view had extra bottom margin (40px vs 5px)
- X-axis labels were rotated 45° requiring extra height (60px vs 30px)

**Fix**:
- Unified margin settings: `bottom: 5` for both views
- Kept x-axis labels horizontal in both views
- Removed all conditional height/angle settings
- Chart now maintains exact same size in both views

## Final Technical Changes

1. **Removed quarterly comparison banner** (lines 1009-1038)
2. **Unified XAxis configuration** (lines 1184-1188):
   - `angle`: Always 0 (horizontal labels)
   - `height`: Always 30px
   - `fontSize`: Always 12
   - `textAnchor`: Always 'middle'
3. **Unified margin configuration** (line 1150):
   - `bottom`: Always 5px (removed conditional 40px)
