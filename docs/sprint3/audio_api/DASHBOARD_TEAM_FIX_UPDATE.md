# Audio API Fix Update - Dashboard Team

**Date**: June 30, 2025  
**Time**: 5:58 PM BST  
**Status**: ✅ CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED

## Issue Found & Fixed

The FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED error was caused by a **route ordering bug** in the API code:

1. The health endpoint was defined AFTER the dynamic `/{episode_id}` route
2. This caused `/health` to be captured as an episode ID
3. ALL requests were failing because of this routing issue

## What Was Fixed

```python
# BEFORE (broken):
@router.get("/{episode_id}")  # This captured ALL paths including /health
...
@router.get("/health")  # Never reached!

# AFTER (fixed):
@router.get("/health")  # Now properly accessible
...
@router.get("/{episode_id}")  # Only captures actual episode IDs
```

## Additional Improvements

1. **Simplified GUID handling**: The API now treats GUIDs as the primary identifier
2. **Better error messages**: Clear indication when ID format is invalid
3. **Cleaner code**: Removed unnecessary complexity

## Current Status

- ✅ Fix pushed to GitHub
- ⏳ Vercel deployment in progress (~6 minutes)
- ✅ Lambda is working correctly
- ✅ MongoDB lookups verified

## Test After Deployment

Once Vercel finishes deploying (check in ~6 minutes):

```bash
# 1. Test health endpoint
curl https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/v1/audio_clips/health

# 2. Test with your GUID
curl "https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/v1/audio_clips/673b06c4-cf90-11ef-b9e1-0b761165641d?start_time_ms=556789"

# 3. Test with known working episode
curl "https://podinsight-api.vercel.app/api/v1/audio_clips/685ba776e4f9ec2f0756267a?start_time_ms=30000"
```

## Expected Results

1. Health endpoint should return:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "service": "audio_clips",
     "lambda_configured": true,
     "mongodb_configured": true
   }
   ```

2. Audio requests should return:
   ```json
   {
     "clip_url": "https://...",
     "cache_hit": true/false,
     "episode_id": "...",
     "start_time_ms": ...,
     "duration_ms": 30000,
     "generation_time_ms": ...
   }
   ```

## Key Understanding

- **GUIDs are the canonical identifier** (link MongoDB to S3)
- **ObjectIds are MongoDB internals only** (no S3 relationship)
- **Search API correctly returns GUIDs** (what you need)

**The route ordering bug was preventing ANY request from working. This is now fixed.**

Please test again once Vercel deployment completes (~6 minutes from now).
