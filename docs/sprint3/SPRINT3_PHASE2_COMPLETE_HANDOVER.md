# Sprint 3 Phase 2 - Complete Session Handover

**Date:** December 30, 2024  
**Session Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Context Usage:** 85%

## 1. Executive Summary

This session focused on addressing timeout issues and audio playback problems in the PodInsight command bar. We successfully:
- Implemented frontend resilience with caching and fallback UI
- Created comprehensive documentation for the API team to fix backend timeouts
- Added extensive debug logging to diagnose audio playback issues

## 2. Complete Work Summary

### 2.1 Timeout Issue Resolution

**Problem:** Queries like "startup funding" timeout after 30 seconds during OpenAI synthesis.

**Root Cause:** Backend API issue - OpenAI client has 2 retries by default, combined with large prompts exceeds Vercel's 30s limit.

**Frontend Mitigations Implemented:**
1. **Response Caching** (`/lib/search-cache.ts`)
   - 5-minute TTL in-memory cache
   - Prevents repeated failing API calls
   - Auto-cleanup to prevent memory leaks

2. **Fallback UI**
   - Shows raw search results when synthesis fails
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Graceful degradation of functionality

3. **API Team Documentation** (`/docs/sprint3/API_TIMEOUT_INVESTIGATION.md`)
   - Complete root cause analysis
   - Specific code fixes with examples
   - Testing protocol and success metrics

### 2.2 Audio Playback Debugging

**Problem:** Play button doesn't work even for successful queries.

**Implemented Solutions:**
1. **Proxy Route** (`/app/api/v1/audio_clips/[episode_id]/route.ts`)
   - Handles CORS issues
   - Centralizes error handling

2. **Comprehensive Debug Logging**
   - Logs source data validation
   - Tracks API request/response
   - Shows audio element state changes
   - Visual error indicators in UI

## 3. File Changes Summary

### Modified Files:
```
/components/dashboard/search-command-bar-fixed.tsx
- Added import for searchCache
- Implemented cache check before API call
- Enhanced error handling with fallback UI
- Added comprehensive audio debug logging
- Fixed audio URL to use proxy route
- Added visual error indicators (AlertCircle icon)

/app/api/search/route.ts
- Already had 30s timeout and AbortController

/app/test-command-bar/page.tsx
- Uses search-command-bar-fixed component
```

### New Files:
```
/lib/search-cache.ts
- SearchCache class with TTL support
- Memory-efficient with size limits

/app/api/v1/audio_clips/[episode_id]/route.ts
- Proxy for audio clip API calls
- Handles CORS and error responses

/docs/sprint3/API_TIMEOUT_INVESTIGATION.md
- Complete investigation guide for API team
- Tiered solution approach
- Code examples and testing protocol

/docs/sprint3/PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
- Current status of all tasks
- Known issues and next steps
```

## 4. Testing Instructions for Audio Playback

### Setup:
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3001/test-command-bar
3. Open browser DevTools (Console + Network tabs)

### Test Protocol:
1. Search for "AI agents" (known to work for synthesis)
2. Wait for results with citations to appear
3. Click any play button
4. **Check Console for:**
   ```
   [Audio Debug] handlePlayAudio called with source: {...}
   [Audio Debug] Fetching audio from: /api/v1/audio_clips/...
   [Audio Debug] Response status: 200
   [Audio Debug] API response: {clip_url: "..."}
   [Audio Debug] Setting audio src to: https://...s3.amazonaws.com...
   [Audio Debug] Playback started successfully
   ```

5. **If errors occur, look for:**
   - `[Audio Error] Invalid source data` - missing episode_id or start_seconds
   - `[Audio Error] HTTP XXX:` - API request failed
   - `[Audio Error] Missing clip_url` - API response malformed
   - `[Audio Error] Failed to play audio` - Browser/CORS issue

### Common Issues to Check:
- Is `source.start_seconds` a valid number?
- Does the API return a `clip_url`?
- Can the S3 URL be accessed directly?
- Are there CORS errors in the Network tab?

## 5. Next Session Prompt

```markdown
I need to continue Sprint 3 Phase 2 implementation for PodInsightHQ command bar.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
@docs/sprint3/sprint3-command-bar-playbookv2.md
@docs/sprint3/SPRINT3_PHASE2_COMPLETE_HANDOVER.md
@docs/sprint3/API_TIMEOUT_INVESTIGATION.md

CURRENT STATUS:
- Frontend caching implemented (5-min TTL)
- Fallback UI shows search results when synthesis fails
- Audio proxy route created to handle CORS
- Comprehensive debug logging added for audio playback
- API team has documentation to fix timeout issues

IMMEDIATE PRIORITY:
Debug and fix audio playback using the enhanced logging.

KEY FILES TO REVIEW:
@components/dashboard/search-command-bar-fixed.tsx - Main component with all fixes
@lib/search-cache.ts - Caching implementation
@app/api/v1/audio_clips/[episode_id]/route.ts - Audio proxy route

TESTING STEPS:
1. Run npm run dev
2. Go to http://localhost:3001/test-command-bar
3. Search for "AI agents"
4. Click play button and check console logs
5. Look for [Audio Debug] and [Audio Error] messages

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Backend synthesis timeouts (blocked on API team)
- Audio playback not working (need to diagnose with logs)
- 2 tests still failing

Please help me debug the audio playback issue by following the testing protocol and analyzing the console output.
```

## 6. Remaining Tasks

1. **High Priority:**
   - Debug audio playback with new logging
   - Fix identified audio issues

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - Update main dashboard to use fixed component
   - Clean up component naming

3. **Low Priority:**
   - Fix remaining 2 test failures
   - Optimize performance further

## 7. Architecture Notes

### Data Flow:
```
User Search → Frontend Cache Check → 
  ↓ (cache miss)
  API Proxy (/api/search) → Backend API → 
    ↓
    Vector Search (1.6s) → OpenAI Synthesis (timeout risk) →
    ↓
  Frontend receives response →
    ↓ (synthesis failed?)
    Show fallback UI with raw results
    ↓ (synthesis succeeded?)
    Show AI answer with citations →
      ↓ (user clicks play)
      Audio Proxy (/api/v1/audio_clips) → Backend API →
        ↓
        S3 Pre-signed URL → Audio Element
```

### Component Structure:
- `SearchCommandBar` - Main component
- `CommandBarContent` - Extracted to prevent re-renders
- `searchCache` - Singleton instance for caching
- Audio state managed via `audioStates` map

**Note:** The frontend is now resilient to backend timeouts. The primary remaining issue is audio playback, which should be diagnosable with the new logging.
