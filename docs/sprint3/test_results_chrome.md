# Sprint 3 Test Results - Chrome MVP

## Date: June 29, 2025

## Test Environment
- Browser: Chrome (latest)
- OS: macOS
- Node: v18+
- Test Framework: Jest + React Testing Library

## Component Tests: SearchCommandBar

### Test Run 1 - Initial Results

**Status**: 5 passed, 10 failed (33% pass rate)

#### Passing Tests ✅
1. Component Rendering > renders the search input with correct placeholder
2. Component Rendering > renders in inline mode by default  
3. Keyboard Shortcuts > shows command hint for Mac users
4. Search Functionality > does not search with less than 4 characters
5. Scroll Behavior > hides on scroll down when threshold is reached

#### Failing Tests ❌
1. **shows keyboard shortcut hint**
   - Issue: Test looking for "/" but component shows "⌘K" or "Ctrl+K"
   - Fix needed: Update test to look for correct shortcut

2. **focuses input when "/" key is pressed**
   - Issue: Modal mode implementation differs from expected behavior
   - Fix needed: Update test for actual modal behavior

3. **triggers search after typing 4+ characters**
   - Issue: Timeout waiting for API call
   - Possible cause: Debounce timing mismatch

4. **shows loading state during search**
   - Issue: Loading spinner not appearing
   - Investigation needed

5. **displays AI answer with citations**
   - Issue: Answer not rendering after API response
   - Investigation needed

6. **shows user-friendly error on API failure**
   - Issue: Error message not found
   - Investigation needed

7. **handles empty results gracefully**
   - Issue: "No relevant discussions found" not showing
   - Investigation needed

8. **opens modal when clicked in modal mode**
   - Issue: Modal backdrop/dialog not found
   - Investigation needed

9. **closes modal when clicking outside**
   - Issue: Cannot find backdrop element
   - Investigation needed

10. **uses mock data from test page when enabled**
    - Issue: Mock answer not appearing
    - Investigation needed

### Known Issues
- Component uses "/" or "⌘K/Ctrl+K" keyboard shortcuts
- Modal mode implementation may differ from test expectations
- Debounce timing is 500ms, tests may need adjustment
- Loading states and error handling need investigation

### Next Steps
1. Fix keyboard shortcut test to match actual implementation
2. Investigate and fix modal mode tests
3. Debug API integration and response handling
4. Ensure loading states are properly tested
5. Verify error handling implementation

## Integration Tests (Cypress) - Pending

Not yet implemented. Will create after component tests pass.

## Performance Metrics - Pending

To be measured after tests are stable.

## Browser Compatibility

Chrome only for MVP - no cross-browser testing performed.
