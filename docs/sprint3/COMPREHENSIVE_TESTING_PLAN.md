# Comprehensive Testing Plan for Search Command Bar

## Current Status
✅ **Core Tests: 17/17 passing**
📊 **Total Tests: 28 (23 passing, 5 failing)**
📈 **Coverage: ~82%**

## Test Implementation Progress

### 1. Edge Cases (Priority: HIGH) - PARTIAL
- [x] Debounce behavior verification ✅
- [x] Special characters handling (SQL injection) ✅
- [x] Very long queries (1000+ characters) ✅
- [ ] Network timeout handling ❌ (cold start message failing)
- [ ] Concurrent search cancellation

### 2. Accessibility (Priority: HIGH) - PARTIAL
- [x] ARIA attributes verification ✅
- [ ] Screen reader announcements
- [x] Modal focus management ✅
- [ ] Keyboard navigation flow (Escape key failing)
- [ ] High contrast mode compatibility

### 3. Security (Priority: HIGH) - MOSTLY DONE
- [ ] XSS prevention in AI answers ❌ (test needs fix)
- [x] XSS prevention in citations ✅
- [x] Input sanitization verification ✅
- [ ] API error message sanitization
- [ ] Content Security Policy compliance

### 4. Performance (Priority: MEDIUM)
- [ ] Debounce consistency under stress
- [ ] Memory leak detection
- [ ] Large payload rendering
- [ ] Component unmount cleanup
- [ ] Re-render optimization

### 5. User Flows (Priority: MEDIUM) - IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Search → Clear → Search again ❌ (state timing issue)
- [ ] Multiple sequential searches ❌ (async order issue)
- [ ] Multiple modal open/close cycles
- [ ] Scroll interactions with results
- [ ] Tab navigation through results
- [ ] Mobile touch interactions

### 6. Integration (Priority: MEDIUM)
- [ ] Multiple component instances
- [ ] Props validation edge cases
- [ ] Parent component integration
- [ ] Event bubbling prevention
- [ ] Context/theme compatibility

### 7. React-Specific (Priority: LOW)
- [ ] useEffect cleanup verification
- [ ] useCallback dependency arrays
- [ ] Ref attachment timing
- [ ] State batching behavior
- [ ] Concurrent mode compatibility

### 8. Browser Compatibility (Priority: LOW)
- [ ] Safari keyboard event handling
- [ ] Firefox focus behavior
- [ ] Mobile Safari viewport issues
- [ ] IE11 fallbacks (if needed)
- [ ] Touch vs mouse events

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Security & Accessibility
1. XSS prevention tests
2. ARIA attributes tests
3. Focus management tests
4. Input sanitization tests

### Phase 2: Edge Cases & Reliability
1. Rapid typing tests
2. Network timeout tests
3. Special characters tests
4. Concurrent search tests

### Phase 3: Performance & UX
1. Memory leak tests
2. Large payload tests
3. User flow tests
4. Multi-instance tests

### Phase 4: Nice-to-Have
1. Browser compatibility tests
2. React-specific edge cases
3. Mobile-specific tests

## Test Implementation Guidelines

### For Edge Case Tests:
```javascript
describe('Edge Cases', () => {
  it('should handle rapid typing and backspacing', async () => {
    // Use fireEvent.change rapidly
    // Verify only final query triggers search
  });
});
```

### For Accessibility Tests:
```javascript
describe('Accessibility', () => {
  it('should have proper ARIA attributes', () => {
    // Check role="searchbox"
    // Verify aria-label
    // Check aria-expanded state
  });
});
```

### For Security Tests:
```javascript
describe('Security', () => {
  it('should prevent XSS in AI answers', async () => {
    // Mock response with <script> tags
    // Verify scripts don't execute
  });
});
```

## Success Metrics
- 100% of HIGH priority tests implemented
- 80% of MEDIUM priority tests implemented
- No security vulnerabilities found
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified
- Performance benchmarks met (debounce < 550ms, render < 16ms)

## Next Steps
1. Implement HIGH priority tests first
2. Run coverage report to identify gaps
3. Add visual regression tests with Percy
4. Create E2E tests with Cypress
5. Performance profiling with React DevTools
