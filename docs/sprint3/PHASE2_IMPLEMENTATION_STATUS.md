# Sprint 3 Phase 2 - Implementation Status

## Date: December 30, 2024
**Last Updated:** 11:10 AM PST

### Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

1. **Timeout Investigation**
   - Identified that timeout issues are happening in the backend API during OpenAI synthesis
   - The issue should be addressed in the `podinsight-api` repository
   - Vector search completes quickly (1.6s) but OpenAI times out after 30s

2. **Frontend Response Caching**
   - Implemented in-memory cache with 5-minute TTL
   - Cache key: query + limit + offset
   - Prevents redundant API calls for repeated searches
   - Cache automatically clears old entries to prevent memory leaks

3. **Fallback UI for Failed Synthesis**
   - When AI synthesis times out, displays raw search results
   - Shows user-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios
   - Improved error messages for timeout (504) and network errors

4. **Audio Playback Improvements**
   - Fixed audio URL to use local proxy route instead of direct API call
   - Added comprehensive error logging and validation
   - Added visual error indicators (red alert icon) when audio fails
   - Shows error message next to failed audio clips
   - Validates `start_seconds` before making API call
   - **NEW**: Added 10-second timeout to audio proxy route to prevent hanging requests
   - **NEW**: Fixed CORS issue by using local proxy route instead of external API

### Remaining Tasks üìã

1. **Update Main Dashboard**
   - Replace `search-command-bar.tsx` with `search-command-bar-fixed.tsx` in main dashboard
   - Test integration with dashboard charts and navigation

2. **Component Cleanup**
   - Rename `search-command-bar-fixed.tsx` back to `search-command-bar.tsx`
   - Remove the old buggy version
   - Update imports throughout the codebase

### Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Backend Timeouts**
   - Some queries (e.g., "startup funding") timeout during OpenAI synthesis
   - This needs to be fixed in the `podinsight-api` repository
   - Potential solutions:
     - Optimize OpenAI prompt and parameters
     - Increase Vercel function timeout
     - Implement streaming responses
     - Add retry logic with shorter timeouts

2. **Audio Playback**
   - Need to verify if audio URLs are being returned correctly from API
   - Check browser console logs for detailed error messages
   - May need CORS headers on S3 bucket for audio files

### Testing Instructions üß™

1. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3001/test-command-bar

3. Test these scenarios:
   - Search for "AI agents" - should work with synthesis
   - Search for "startup funding" - may timeout, should show fallback
   - Try playing audio clips - check console for debug logs
   - Test cache by searching same query twice

4. Check browser console for:
   - `[Audio Debug]` logs showing the flow
   - `[Audio Error]` logs if playback fails
   - Network tab to verify API calls

### Next Steps üöÄ

1. **Immediate**: Test audio playback with working queries to identify the specific issue
2. **Short-term**: Update main dashboard with fixed component
3. **Long-term**: Work with API team to fix synthesis timeouts

### Code Changes Summary

- Created `/lib/search-cache.ts` for caching
- Updated `/components/dashboard/search-command-bar-fixed.tsx`:
  - Added caching logic
  - Improved error handling
  - Enhanced audio debugging
  - Added visual error indicators
- Created proxy route `/app/api/v1/audio_clips/[episode_id]/route.ts`
- **NEW**: Updated `/app/api/v1/audio_clips/[episode_id]/route.ts` with 10-second timeout
- **NEW**: Updated `/docs/sprint3/HOW_TO_RUN_DASHBOARD_AND_SEARCH_BAR.md` with:
  - Port 3001 information
  - Known issues section covering timeouts and audio problems
  - Debugging instructions
- **NEW**: Fixed CORS issue in `/components/dashboard/search-command-bar-fixed.tsx`
  - Changed to use local proxy `/api/search` instead of external API
- **NEW**: Fixed mock fetch interference in `/app/test-command-bar/page.tsx`
  - Mock fetch now only intercepts search API, allows audio through
