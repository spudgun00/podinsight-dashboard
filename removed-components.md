# Component Removal Tracking - Sprint 1 Phase 0

**Date:** June 17, 2025  
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 - Phase 0 (Technical Debt Resolution)  
**Action:** Smart Component Cleanup (Minimal Approach)

## Components Removed

The following 6 components were removed due to TypeScript errors (`@ts-nocheck` directive):

1. **calendar.tsx**
   - Had @ts-nocheck on line 1
   - Not imported anywhere in the codebase
   - Used react-day-picker package

2. **carousel.tsx**
   - Had @ts-nocheck on line 1
   - Not imported anywhere in the codebase
   - Used embla-carousel-react package

3. **drawer.tsx**
   - Had @ts-nocheck on line 1
   - Not imported anywhere in the codebase
   - Used vaul package

4. **input-otp.tsx**
   - Had @ts-nocheck on line 1
   - Not imported anywhere in the codebase
   - Used input-otp package

5. **resizable.tsx**
   - Had @ts-nocheck on line 1
   - Not imported anywhere in the codebase
   - Used react-resizable-panels package

6. **sonner.tsx**
   - Had @ts-nocheck on line 1
   - Not imported anywhere in the codebase
   - Used sonner package
   - Note: We have a working toast system using toast.tsx/toaster.tsx

## Packages to Remove

The following packages should be removed from package.json as they were only used by the deleted components:

```bash
npm uninstall react-day-picker embla-carousel-react vaul input-otp react-resizable-panels sonner
```

## Packages Kept

All @radix-ui packages were kept as they are needed for Sprint 1 features:
- Auth modals will use @radix-ui/react-dialog
- User menu will use @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu
- Tabs for sentiment view will use @radix-ui/react-tabs
- Audio player will use @radix-ui/react-slider

## How to Restore If Needed

If any of these components need to be restored:

1. The files can be recovered from git history:
   ```bash
   git show HEAD~1:components/ui/[component-name].tsx > components/ui/[component-name].tsx
   ```

2. Reinstall the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install [package-name]
   ```

3. Fix the TypeScript errors instead of using @ts-nocheck

## Impact

- **Bundle Size:** Expected reduction from current 235KB
- **TypeScript:** 6 fewer files with disabled type checking
- **Dependencies:** 6 fewer packages to maintain
- **No Breaking Changes:** None of these components were imported or used
