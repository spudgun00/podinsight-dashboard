# Sprint 3 Testing Handover - Updated Status

## Current Testing Status: 50% Complete (8/16 tests passing)

### ✅ Tests Passing:
1. Component rendering tests (3/3)
2. Modal mode tests (2/2)
3. Scroll behavior test (1/1)
4. Mac keyboard hint display (1/1)
5. Debounce prevention test (1/1)

### ❌ Tests Still Failing:
1. **Keyboard Shortcuts (2 tests)**
   - "/" key press to focus input
   - Cmd+K to focus input
   - Issue: Focus not transferring despite correct event handling

2. **API Integration (6 tests)**
   - Search trigger after 4+ chars
   - Loading state display
   - AI answer display
   - Error handling
   - Empty results handling
   - Mock data integration

### Key Technical Findings:
1. Component uses `document.addEventListener('keydown')` with check for input/textarea targets
2. Uses 500ms debounce with `setTimeout`
3. All tests properly use `jest.useFakeTimers()` and `act()` wrappers
4. Component has `e.preventDefault()` for keyboard shortcuts

### Recommendations for Next Session:
1. Consider mocking `inputRef` directly for keyboard tests
2. Debug why `inputRef.current?.focus()` isn't working in test environment
3. Verify ref is attached to input element during render
4. Consider using `@testing-library/react-hooks` to test ref behavior
